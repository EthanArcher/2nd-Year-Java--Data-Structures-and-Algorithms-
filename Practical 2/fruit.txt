Scientists in Japan have revealed the shape of fruit to come.  You've probably noticed
something peculiar about these watermelons - yes, that's right -  they're square! Scientists
came up with the brainwave to make the melons easier to pack and stop them rolling off shelves.
So how on earth did they get them to grow into cubes? Farmers grew the melons in glass boxes when 
they were young and still on the vine. The fruit then took the shape of the casing around them. 
So with square melons now available in Japanese supermarkets who knows what the future of fruit 
could be.
